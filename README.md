# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is an effective technique to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It helps you identify potential threats and risk reduction strategies earlier in the development lifecycle.

Threat modeling uses a data-flow diagram that graphically shows how the system works. It then applies a framework to help you find and fix security issues.

The technique is broken down into four different phases, each containing important steps to help you create a data-flow diagram and analyze it for potential threats.

1. Design : Capture all requirements for your system and create a data-flow diagram.
2. Break : Apply a threat modeling framework to the data-flow diagram and find potential security issues.
3. Fix : Decide how to approach each issue with the right combination of security controls.
4. Verify : Verify requirements are met, issues are found, and security controls are implemented.

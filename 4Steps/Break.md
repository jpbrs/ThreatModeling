# Break

The break phase is where you use the data-flow diagram to find potential threats against your system. The process uses a threat modeling framework to help you find the most common threats and ways to protect against them. You select a focus area with an associated framework to systematically identify potential threats in your system

## Goals

1. Choose between "protecting the system" or "understanding the attacker" focused approaches
2. Use the STRIDE framework to identify common threats

## Focus your approach

Start by choosing whether you want to find ways to protect your system or understand all you can about an attacker and their motives. Examples include:

| **Focus** | **Example of what you can find** |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| System | You find an issue with an unencrypted connection between the user and the system. |
| Attacker | You find out more about means, motivation, and ways to harden the system entry points. |
| Asset | You identify critical assets based on things like classified data handling and focus mostly on protecting those assets. |
